The high level State Machine is defined by the Controller.py GLOBAL variables *possibleStates* and *trafficFlowTransitions*

This test required ~538 lines of code to complete

Code was linted using Flake8 with custom 135 line lengths 

Future optimizations:
1. In GlobalConstants implement "Traffic light ID & Lane CONTSTANTS" definition via CSV file import
2. Finish Flask GUI update by passing sensor and traffic light Lists to render_temple() function to change CSS
